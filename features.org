*  Advanced keyboard driven Desktop Environment
Custom Linux desktop environment built on EXWM and Elisp programming language, integrated with Xorg.

** Core Window Management
- Built on **EXWM** (Emacs X Window Manager) with Xorg display server.
- Supports **line-mode / char-mode** switching for flexible key handling.
- Custom `anup/other-window` implementation for **multi-monitor aware window cycling**.
- Mouse-focus handling via **exwm-mff** (mouse follows focus).
- Window titles auto-renamed based on **application class + page title/URL**.
- Configured **multi-monitor setups** (single, dual, triple) with `exwm-randr` hooks and custom refresh logic.
- Defined custom **workspace-to-monitor mappings** (iMac + vertical + horizontal monitors).
- Functions to move buffers across monitors (`C-c RET`).
- Implemented `exwm-randr-refresh2` to fix EXWM triple monitor refresh bugs.

** Input & Keybindings
- Unified **global keybinding overrides** across all frames/monitors.
- Mapped Emacs-style navigation (`C-n`, `C-p`, `C-f`, `C-b`, etc.) to X11 windows.
- Copy/paste and undo mapped (`M-w`, `C-w`, `C-y`, `C-/`) consistently across Emacs and X apps.
- Custom bindings for Google Chrome & Qutebrowser (reload, copy, navigation).
- Added simulation keys for word/paragraph navigation, delete, select-all, etc.
- Shortcuts for **launching external apps** (`C-c p`).
- Disabled unused EXWM defaults (fullscreen, floating, hiding).
- Made VS Code and Edwin always open in **char-mode**.

** Application Integration
- **Web browser integration**: Buffer names auto-sync with URL/title → enables **completion-based tab switching**.
- Configured **qutebrowser session auto-wipe** on logout to avoid session restore.
- Integrated **helm-exwm** for better Emacs vs EXWM buffer listing.
- Added support for **exwm-edit** (edit textareas of X apps inside Emacs).
- Leechblock-like filtering for Chrome app launch list.

** UI & Usability
- Responsive **multi-monitor DPI compromise** hacks (font resizing on iMac screen).
- Adjusted **fringe size**, disabled scrollbars/menu-bar for a cleaner look.
- Implemented **mouse auto-hide** with unclutter.
- Custom fallback cursor (`xsetroot -cursor left_ptr`).
- Font scaling hooks triggered after EXWM init.
- Blackout screen on logout (disabled due to bugs).
- Auto-bury windows from drawing tablet settings panel.

** Startup & Autostart
- System initialization via `~/.xinitrc` integrated into EXWM hooks.
- Auto-start services:
  - **Dropbox client**
  - **NetworkManager applet**
  - **Drawing tablet driver reload** (usbreset integration)
  - **Pulseaudio / pamixer** volume control bindings
  - **unclutter** (auto-hide mouse)
  - **disable screen blanking / DPMS**
- Configured **keyboard repeat rate** (200ms delay, 60/s repeat).
- Environment variables for **XDG compliance**, GTK/QT integration, Java non-reparenting WM flag.
- Planned autostart for compositor (xcompmgr), notifications (dunst), and polkit manager.

** System Management
- Functions to **shutdown, reboot, suspend, or kill X server** directly from Emacs.
- Custom graceful shutdown hook bound to `kill-emacs`.
- Functions to programmatically send keys (via xdotool) to background X apps (e.g., Rails app reload).

** Buffer & Completion System
- Fixed Helm/Ivy buffer switching to include EXWM buffers from all frames.
- Customized helm/ivy **boring buffer filters** to hide temp, compile logs, mpv windows, etc.
- Improved buffer switching completion (`C-x b`) ordering and filtering logic.
- Dynamic completion integration across Emacs + X windows.

** Miscellaneous
- Auto-start and reset **drawing tablet driver** with usbreset + passwordless sudo.
- Added **custom kill-ring browser** (`M-y`) integration.
- Configurable **single / dual / triple monitor setups** via elisp functions.
- Optional keybinding hacks (`C-s`, `C-k`, `C-o`, `M-<`, `M->`) mapped consistently to X apps.
- Infrastructure for future keyboard remaps (CapsLock → Ctrl, trackpad disable).
